2. Download the Debian image used in the ProjectApollo, from the link below:

http://debian.beagleboard.org/images/bone-debian-9.3-lxqt-armhf-2018-01-28-4gb.img.xz

3. Download the software Etcher, from the link below:

https://www.balena.io/etcher/

4. Mount the image into the SD card, using Etcher:

Launch the Etcher program.
Click 'Select Image' and browse to the 'bone-debian-9.3-lxqt-armhf-2018-01-28-4gb.img.xz' you downloaded at Step 2.
Click 'Flash!'.

5. Unplug the SD card adapter from your PC and then download the latest release from ProjectApollo repo:

https://github.com/busypete/projectapollo/releases/download/v1.0/install.zip

6. Extract the 'install.zip' file you downloaded and enter into the 'install' directory just extracted:

cd install

7. Insert the SD card into the board adapter. Holding the S1 button, plug in the board in your PC using the USB cable.

NOTE: It is necessary that you keep holding the button until the blue LED's in your board light up.

8. Execute the installation script.

chmod u+x install_script.sh
./install_script.sh -v

9. Wait until the board is turned off (the LEDs will be steady off). It's all ready. Plug out the board from your PC and plug out the SD card from your board. You won't need it anymore. Next time you apply power to your board, it will boot on the Scope application. 

10. Enjoy!
